## Ownership

All tournaments are owned by a community organization (Discord server, content creator community, friend group, etc.). Community organizers and authorized members can create tournaments for their organization.

## Creation

Tournament creation is available to community organizers and members with appropriate permissions within their grassroots organizations. This enables content creators, Discord moderators, and community leaders to easily host tournaments for their communities.

## Structure

Tournaments are scoped to their organization. Each tournament has a unique slug within its organization.
