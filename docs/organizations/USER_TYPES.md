# User Types

> **Note:** This documentation is Obsidian-compatible. Use [[WikiLinks]] for navigation.

These are user types that interact with organizations and tournaments, but are **not organization staff roles**. Organization staff roles are documented in [[roles/ORG_ROLES|Organization Roles]].

## Player

Players are users who participate in tournaments. They:

- Register for tournaments
- View own matches, standings, and analytics
- Drop from tournaments (if allowed)
- Submit decklists/teamsheets (if required)

Players do not "belong" to an organization — they simply register for tournaments hosted by organizations.

---

## Spectator (Future)

Spectators are users who view tournaments without participating. They:

- View public brackets, standings, and streams
- Follow favorite players or teams
