# 👥 Groups & Templates

> **Note:** This documentation is Obsidian-compatible. Use [[WikiLinks]] for navigation.

Groups are broad collections of users within an organization, used to delegate responsibilities and manage access. Each group can have one or more granular roles assigned to its members, controlling what they can do.

## 🏗️ Default Organization Structure Template

> **This is the default template for new organizations. More templates may be added in the future.**

- **Admins**
  - Roles: Owner, Admin, Tournament Director, Communications Manager
- **Judges**
  - Roles: Head Judge, Lead Judge, Judge, Penalty Manager, Appeals Handler
- **Staff**
  - Roles: Scorekeeper, Registration Staff, Streamer/Media, Player Dropper, Deck/Teamlist Verifier, Pairings Publisher, Check-in Manager, Media Uploader, Result Verifier, Bracket Manager, Sponsor Liaison, Prize Manager
- **Players**
  - Roles: Player
- **Spectators**
  - Roles: Spectator, Spectator Moderator

> Groups are broad (e.g., "Judges"), but roles within groups are granular and determine what each member can do. For example, not all Judges can enter scores—only those with the Scorekeeper role. Similarly, only those with the Player Dropper role can drop players from tournaments.

Organizations can customize their group and role assignments as needed, but this structure keeps things simple and clear for most use cases.
