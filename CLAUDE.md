## Auto-Delegation

The orchestrator's job is routing and review — not inline execution. For each task type below, dispatch the listed agent **without being asked**. Inline execution is the exception and needs an explicit user request.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Feature design, architecture, UI/UX exploration, "how should we…"   | `planner`                | foreground                   |
| Implementing a planned feature or fix (any non-trivial code change) | `feature-implementer`    | foreground                   |
| Writing or extending tests (unit, integration, e2e)                 | `qa-engineer`            | foreground                   |
| A diff exists and is about to be committed                          | `code-reviewer`          | foreground, before commit    |
| A new file landed in `packages/supabase/supabase/migrations/`       | `migration-reviewer`     | foreground, before push      |
| Diff touches auth, RLS policies, `proxy.ts`, or session handling    | `security-reviewer`      | foreground, before push      |
| Diff touches `packages/supabase/supabase/functions/`                | `edge-function-reviewer` | foreground, before push      |
| Diff changed `apps/web/src/**/*.tsx` presentation/layout            | `ui-verifier`            | foreground, before push      |
| A `git push` just landed on a branch with an open PR                | `ci-monitor`             | **background — never block** |
| A git push just landed (any branch)                                 | `background-checker`     | **background — never block** |
| Creating a PR / the parity hook fired on `apps/web/` changes        | `parity-checker`         | background                   |
| Local quality checks explicitly requested                           | `pre-push-checker`       | foreground                   |

Rules:

- Multiple triggers can fire on one diff (a migration + web UI dispatches `migration-reviewer` AND `ui-verifier`) — run reviewers in parallel.
- `ci-monitor` is dispatched after **every** push, in the background, in the same turn as the push. Do not poll CI inline.
- Reviewer findings are fixed in the current session (no deferrals), then the relevant reviewer re-runs.

### Playwright Screenshots

Store all Playwright MCP screenshots in `.playwright-mcp/screenshots/`. This directory is gitignored.

### Dev Server Logs

Dev server logs (Next.js + Supabase edge functions) are written to `.dev-logs/` when `pnpm dev` or `pnpm dev:web` starts. Each run creates a timestamped file (e.g. `dev-20260606-143022.log`); `.dev-logs/dev.log` is a symlink to the latest.

- `tail -200 .dev-logs/dev.log` — recent output
- `grep -a "error\|Error\|failed" .dev-logs/dev.log` — find issues

The file contains ANSI color codes; grep still works fine.

### Gotchas

- **Always run `pnpm supabase` from `packages/supabase`** — never from the repo root. The Supabase CLI writes its linked-project cache to a `supabase/.temp/` subdirectory in the current working directory; running from root pollutes the repo root with an untracked `supabase/.temp/linked-project.json`. The package-level path is already gitignored at `packages/supabase/supabase/.temp/`.
- `pnpm dev` always reconfigures `.env.local` for local Supabase — set `SKIP_LOCAL_SUPABASE=1` to use remote instead
- All env vars live in root `.env.local`, symlinked into apps/packages via `postinstall.sh`
- When adding build-time env vars, declare them in `turbo.json` under the task's `env` array (cache invalidation)
- **`@smogon/calc` is a git submodule — do NOT re-pin it to a git tarball** — `apps/web` depends on `@smogon/calc` via `file:../../vendor/damage-calc/calc`, a git submodule of the fork `thatguyinabeanie/damage-calc` (`vendor/damage-calc`, pinned to a commit that **commits the built `calc/dist/`**). Never change it back to `github:thatguyinabeanie/damage-calc#<sha>&path:/calc`. That git-tarball form **cannot be resolved by pnpm 11 under `--frozen-lockfile`** in CI/Vercel: it lands with no `dist/` (`Cannot find module '@smogon/calc'`) or as the fork's private monorepo root (`undefined@0.0.0` store mismatch). It only works in non-frozen local installs that build it, which masks the failure. The submodule + `file:` makes pnpm **symlink** the committed `dist/` deterministically. Requirements: all GitHub Actions `actions/checkout` steps use `submodules: recursive`; keep the Vercel project's "Git submodules" setting enabled; a root `preinstall` runs `git submodule update --init --recursive`; `@smogon/calc` is **absent** from `allowBuilds` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. To update calc: bump the submodule pointer (keep `dist/` committed in the fork).
- **pnpm config lives in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, not `package.json`** — pnpm 11 **does not read** the `pnpm` field in `package.json` (prints `[WARN]` and silently ignores `overrides`, `packageExtensions`, `onlyBuiltDependencies`, `ignoredBuiltDependencies`). Never add a `pnpm` field back to `package.json`. Put `overrides:`, `packageExtensions:`, and `allowBuilds:` directly in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
- **Chunk unbounded Supabase `.in()` filters** — A `.in("col", ids)` with hundreds of ids builds a PostgREST URL that overflows the server URI limit and returns `{ error: "URI too long" }`. If that error is ignored, `data` is null and downstream logic silently drops every row. Use `fetchInChunks()` in `packages/supabase/src/queries/players.ts` as the reference: split into ≤100-id chunks, merge, and **throw** on chunk error. Always `.error`-check `.in()` queries that fan out over an unbounded id list. **The bug only reproduces at scale** — a few-row seed hides it.
- **Anon SELECT revoked on 19 S-bucket base tables — with a realtime-six carve-out** — Phase 2 revoked anon (and public) SELECT on 19 core tables. Six tables kept authenticated SELECT to allow Supabase Realtime subscriptions for logged-in users: `notifications`, `match_games`, `match_messages`, `tournament_matches`, `tournament_registrations`, `tournament_rounds`. Spectators and logged-out users get SSR/ISR snapshots — no realtime. Any new table that needs realtime must go through the same carve-out process (migration + RLS policy). Using `createStaticClient()` (anon key) on a revoked table returns an empty result set, not an error — silent data loss. Use `createServiceRoleClient()` with `resolveApiAuth` + `enforceRateLimit` for anon-reachable `/api/v1` routes that read from revoked tables.

## Critical Rules

### Push Policy

**You do NOT need to run lint, typecheck, tests, or E2E locally before committing or pushing.** CI runs all of them — offload these checks to CI rather than blocking the commit/push on a local run. Running them locally is optional (fine for fast iteration on a focused change), never required.

- Implementing agents never run lint/typecheck/tests inline — not before commit, not before push.
- The orchestrator commits and pushes freely and frequently. Subagents never commit or push — they report changed files plus a suggested commit message.
- In the same turn as every push, dispatch BOTH in the background: `background-checker` (haiku — scoped `pnpm typecheck --filter` / `pnpm lint --filter` on changed packages) and `ci-monitor` (haiku — watches CI).
- Fix reported failures in follow-up commits; never leave red CI unaddressed.

**After every push, check CI.** Once the push lands, monitor the CI run and enumerate each check by name with its status:

1. `pnpm lint` — ESLint across all packages
2. `pnpm typecheck` — TypeScript type checking
3. `pnpm test` — Full unit test suite
4. `pnpm test:e2e` — Playwright E2E tests

Use `gh pr checks <branch>` (or the Actions UI). If any CI check fails, fix the issue and push again — don't leave a red CI unaddressed. See "Completion Claims" below for enumerating checks before declaring CI green.

### Parallel Work & Unexpected Changes

Multiple agents and humans may work on this codebase simultaneously. If you encounter code changes, new files, or modified files that you did not make — they were either made manually by the developer or by another parallel agent. **Never delete, revert, overwrite, or undo changes you did not make.** Treat unfamiliar changes as intentional. If they conflict with your work, stop and ask rather than discarding them.

### Error Visibility

**Never suppress errors with `2>/dev/null`, `|| true`, or `|| exit 0`.** If a command can fail, the failure must be visible. Guard against expected empty inputs (e.g., check `[ -n "$VAR" ]` before using it), but never hide real errors. Silent failures waste hours of debugging.

**Never merge stderr into stdout with `2>&1`.** Keep stdout and stderr as separate streams. Merging them makes it impossible to distinguish errors from normal output when inspecting subagent processes.

### Styling: Tailwind Over CSS Modules

**Always use Tailwind CSS utility classes instead of writing or editing CSS module files.** Do not add new rules to `.module.css` files — express all styling via Tailwind classes in the component JSX. Existing CSS module rules may remain for legacy reasons, but new work should never introduce more. If a design requires something Tailwind cannot express (e.g., complex selectors, animations with multiple keyframes), use inline `style` props or a `<style>` tag scoped to the component before reaching for a CSS module.

**Never use arbitrary pixel values** (`w-[Npx]`, `min-w-[Npx]`, `max-w-[Npx]`, `h-[Npx]`, etc.) — new or pre-existing. Use Tailwind's built-in spacing/sizing scale (`w-96` = 384px, `w-80` = 320px, `max-w-lg`, etc.). Remove any `[Npx]` values encountered while working in a file.

### React Compiler

**Do NOT write `useMemo`, `useCallback`, or `React.memo`** — React Compiler handles memoization across all packages automatically. Manual memoization conflicts with compiler optimizations.

### Database Migrations

**Never apply migrations via MCP tools or the Supabase dashboard.** All schema changes via migration files. Never edit or rename a committed migration file. See `create-migration` skill for full conventions.

### Edge Function Deployments

**Never deploy edge functions manually.** They deploy automatically during the Vercel build. Never declare in `config.toml`. See `creating-edge-functions` skill for details.

### Scope Discipline

**Only modify files explicitly in scope for the current task.** Do NOT run `pnpm format`, `pnpm lint --fix`, or other repo-wide formatters unless explicitly asked. When dispatching subagents, pass an explicit file allowlist and forbid edits outside it. If unrelated changes sneak in, revert them before committing.

### Data Access

**Split model — no open anon Data API.** Phase 2 revoked anon SELECT on 19 S-bucket base tables; authenticated SELECT was kept.

- **S-bucket client reads** → cached `/api/v1` routes (`createServiceRoleClient` + column allowlist + `resolveApiAuth` + `enforceRateLimit`).
- **Authenticated direct reads** → browser Supabase client + RLS (`createClient`, `authenticated` role).
- **SSR pages** → query DB directly server-side (no round-trip through `/api/v1`).
- **Mobile (hybrid)** → authed reads stay direct Supabase (RLS via SecureStore session); public/unauth reads use cached `/api/v1`. Full cutover deferred until mobile dev resumes.

See `deciding-data-access`, `querying-supabase`, and `reviewing-caching` skills for routing decisions and client selection.

### Destructive Actions

**Words like "clean up", "reorganize", "fix up", or "sort out" are ambiguous — never default to delete.** When the request could mean move/merge/archive/rename, confirm the user's intended semantics before running any bulk-delete (rm -rf, mass DELETE in a loop, dropping tables, wiping directories). Default to the least destructive interpretation and present destructive options via `AskUserQuestion` with a non-destructive first option.

### Subagent Model Selection

| Model                 | Use for                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **haiku**             | Mechanical work: scoped lint/typecheck/test runs (`background-checker`), CI status fetch (`ci-monitor`), log/grep reading, Playwright measure-and-report, parity checks |
| **sonnet**            | Implementation, fixes, test writing, code review                                                                                                                        |
| **opus / main agent** | Orchestration, design, and final review only — never inline execution, never ingesting raw logs or snapshots                                                            |

Pass `model` explicitly on every Agent dispatch. Anything that produces large output (test runs, CI logs, Playwright snapshots, grep dumps) runs inside a subagent that returns a concise report — the orchestrator's context stays lean.

### Completion Claims

**Never declare a PR "ready to merge" before every review thread is resolved and CI is green.** For PR-feedback work, use the `reviewing-pr-feedback` skill — it enforces fetch-all-comments → group → fix → reply → resolve → re-review before completion.

**No "deferred" / "follow-up" / "for future" buckets.** When reviewing PRs, databases, caching, or code, address every finding in the current session. Only label something as deferred if the user explicitly tells you to. Review skills (`reviewing-pr-feedback`, `reviewing-pr`, `reviewing-database`, `reviewing-caching`) all share this rule — see the "No Deferrals" section in each.

**Enumerate every CI check by name with pass/fail/pending before declaring CI green.** "CI is running" or "CI looks good" is not evidence — list each check (Lint, Typecheck, Tests, codecov/patch, E2E, preview deploys) and its current status. See Phase 1 of `reviewing-pr-feedback` and the report format in the `pre-push-checker` agent.

## Product Vision

Community-first, not an esports site. See `product-vision` and `competitive-landscape` skills for vision, roadmap, differentiators, and positioning.

## Design Principles

- **Personality:** Clean, Playful, Community-driven — data-rich and precise where it matters, but warm, friendly, and never cold or intimidating
- **Anti-reference:** NOT an esports/gaming site — no dark aggressive "gamer" aesthetic, no neon accents, no angular/militaristic UI
- **Audience:** All ages, mixed tech comfort, equal desktop/mobile priority
- Teal primary (OKLCH tokens from `@trainers/theme`): single accent across all interactive elements
- Minimal flat design: no borders, subtle background differentiation, consistent spacing
- `StatusBadge` for semantic status colors (emerald=active, blue=upcoming, amber=draft, gray=completed, red=cancelled)
- WCAG AA minimum accessibility

## Development Workflow

When executing implementation plans, always use **subagent-driven development** (`superpowers:subagent-driven-development`). Do not use inline execution unless explicitly asked.

### Parallel Execution

- Implementation plans end with a **Dependency & parallelism map**: tasks grouped into waves; tasks in the same wave touch disjoint file sets and have no data dependency.
- When executing a plan, dispatch ALL tasks in the current wave in a single message (multiple Agent calls — they run concurrently), one subagent per task, each with an explicit disjoint file allowlist.
- Sequence only true dependencies. The orchestrator commits between waves — subagents never commit or push; they return changed files plus a suggested commit message, and one committer avoids git races between parallel agents.
- If a plan lacks a parallelism map, derive one before dispatching — never default to sequential out of convenience.
- See `superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents` for mechanics.

## Project Management

Linear for issue tracking (MCP server available). **Team**: `trainers-gg`. **Default Project**: `Private Beta MVP`.

<!-- VERCEL BEST PRACTICES START -->

## Best practices for developing on Vercel

These defaults are optimized for AI coding agents (and humans) working on apps that deploy to Vercel.

- Treat Vercel Functions as stateless + ephemeral (no durable RAM/FS, no background daemons), use Blob or marketplace integrations for preserving state
- Edge Functions (standalone) are deprecated; prefer Vercel Functions
- Don't start new projects on Vercel KV/Postgres (both discontinued); use Marketplace Redis/Postgres instead
- Store secrets in Vercel Env Variables; not in git or `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`
- Provision Marketplace native integrations with `vercel integration add` (CI/agent-friendly)
- Sync env + project settings with `vercel env pull` / `vercel pull` when you need local/offline parity
- Use `waitUntil` for post-response work; avoid the deprecated Function `context` parameter
- Set Function regions near your primary data source; avoid cross-region DB/service roundtrips
- Tune Fluid Compute knobs (e.g., `maxDuration`, memory/CPU) for long I/O-heavy calls (LLMs, APIs)
- Use Runtime Cache for fast **regional** caching + tag invalidation (don't treat it as global KV)
- Use Cron Jobs for schedules; cron runs in UTC and triggers your production URL via HTTP GET
- Use Vercel Blob for uploads/media; Use Edge Config for small, globally-read config
- If Enable Deployment Protection is enabled, use a bypass secret to directly access them
- Add OpenTelemetry via `@vercel/otel` on Node; don't expect OTEL support on the Edge runtime
- Enable Web Analytics + Speed Insights early
- Use AI Gateway for model routing, set AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY, using a model string (e.g. 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6'), Gateway is already default in AI SDK
  needed. Always curl https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/v1/models first; never trust model IDs from memory
- For durable agent loops or untrusted code: use Workflow (pause/resume/state) + Sandbox; use Vercel MCP for secure infra access
